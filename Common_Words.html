<h1>Common Words and their definition</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Mutable - Type of variable that can be changed.</br>
        In JS, objects and arrays are mutable, not primitive values.</br>
        </br>
        <em>Mutable - An object whose state can be modified after it is created.</em></br>
        <em>Immutables - objects whose state cannot be changed once it is created.</em></br>
        <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Mutable>Source </a>
    </li>
</br>
    <li>
            Data hiding - Allows us to change names of our instance variables</br>
            without forcing the users of our object to change how they use it.</br>
            Using a method to access instead of accessing the data fields</br>
    </li>
</br>
    <li>
        Map function - creates a copy of the previous array/item (therefore</br>
        leaves the original dataset untouched)</br>
    </li>
</br>
    <li>
        Garbage collection - once the object/attribute/method (resource?) is no longer</br>
        being referenced, then it can be cleared up to make space for memory</br>
    </li>
</br>
    <li>
        Public static void -</br>
        </br>
        Public means it is visible and can be called from other objects of other types</br>
        </br>
        Static means the method is associated with class, not an instance. It can be</br>
        called without creating an object</br>
        </br>
        Void means it returns no value</br>
    </li>
</br>
    <li>
        Recurssion - the process of taking a big problem and sub dividing into</br>
        multiple, smaller instances of the same problem</br>
        In practice, its a function that calls itself and outputs a result</br>
        once the stack has unwinded</br>
    </li>
</ul>
