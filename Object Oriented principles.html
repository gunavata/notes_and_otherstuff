<h1>Object oriented principles</h1>

<ul>
    <li>
        Simlarities between non OOP approach:</br>
        Variables that store information and other data.</br>
        Procedures (AKA functions, methods, routines) that take input, generate output and manipulate data</br>
    </li>
</br>
    <li>
        Objects and Clases:</br>
        Usually support inheritence for code reusability and extensibility. Two support concepts</br>
        Classes = data members and member functions grouped together (The blueprint)</br>
        Objects = instance of the class (The created item from the blueprint)</br>
    </li>
</br>
    <li>
        Abstraction:</br>
        A class that cannot be instantiated, it exist only to be inherited into other</br>
        concrete classes.</br>
        Employee abstracts into hourly vs salary followed by manager vs staff or fulltime vs parttime</br>
        Shape abstract with methods to calculate display and area into rectangle, circle and triangle</br>
    </li>
</br>
    <li>
        Encapsulation:</br>
        Binds together data and functions that manipulate it and keep it</br>
        safe from outside interference and misues. Important part of data hiding</br>
        It allows you to tamper with the attributes or access methods ONLY through</br>
        the related methods in the class</br>
    </li>
</br>
    <li>
        Polymorphism:</br>
        Concept where an object behaves differently in different situations.</br>
        Core concept of method overloading where depending on what is passed/received</br>
        the correct method is used i.e draw() vs draw(int) returns a different</br>
        method due to what is passed as an argument</br>
    </li>
</br>
    <li>
        Inheritence - mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class</br>
        retaining similiar implementation.</br>
        Subclass(Child) & Superclass(Parent)</br>
    </br>
        Single inheritence = A -> B</br>
        Multiple inheritence = A + B -> C</br>
        Multilevel inheritence = A -> B -> C</br>
        Hierarchical inheritence = A -> B && A -> C && A -> D</br>
        Hybrid inheritence = Mix of 2 or more of the above</br>
    </br>
        Two important properties</br>
        Overriding = the child class overrides the parent's class attribute or method</br>
        to be more specific or unique</br>
        Code reuse = Inheriting the parent class because most code is being used</br>
        but with slight difference (hence overriding)</br>
     </li>
</br>
    <li>
        Association:</br>
        Relationship between objects (Database relationship)</br>
        One to many/Many to one/One to one/Many to many</br>
        Both objects are independant of each other however</br>
    </br>
        Aggregation is a type of relationship that defines ownership</br>
        Has-a type relationship. </br>
    </br>
        Composition is a type of aggregation that also specifies that</br>
        the child cannot exist without the parent i.e a room object cannot exist</br>
        without a house object</br>
    </li>
</br>
</ul>
