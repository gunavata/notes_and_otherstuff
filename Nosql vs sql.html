<h1>NoSQL(MongoDB) vs SQL(MySQL)</h1>

<h4>
    Main difference is that</br>
    NOSQL databases do NOT use relational models i.e MongoDB</br>
    SQL Databases use relational models i.e MySQL
</h4>

<h6>Relational database advantages (MySQL)</h6>

<ul>
    <li>
        Less expensive since more mainstream
    </li>
    <li>
        Better support, product suites, add ons (again due to more mainstream)
    </li>
    <li>
        Atomicity of operations - database relies on entire operation completing otherwise not done at all
    </li>
    <li>
        Must comply with integrity requirements for data type and compatibility
    </li>
</ul>

<h6>Relational database disadvantages (MySQL)</h6>

<ul>
    <li>
        Atomicity operations affects performance
    </li>
    <li>
        Scalability is usually lower than nosql
    </li>
</ul>

<h6>NoSQL (non relational) advantages (MongoDB)</h6>

<ul>
    <li>
        Scalability and decentralized, supports distributed structures
    </li>
    <li>
        More open and flexible as databases. Allow adapting to needs of a project much easier than relational models
    </li>
    <li>
        Changes in schemas can be done without stoping database
    </li>
    <li>
        Horizontal scaling, capable of growing in device number instead of residing in one large device
    </li>
    <li>
        Can run on low resource devices
    </li>
    <li>
        Query optimation on databases designed for large amounts of data
    </li>
</ul>

<h6>NoSQL (non relational) disadvantages (MongoDB)</h6>

<ul>
    <li>
        Not all database contemplate atomicity of instructions and integrity of data. Expects eventual consistence.
    </li>
    <li>
        Compatibility with SQL instructions. Have their own chracteristics in query language. Support for query in NoSQL is more complicated
    </li>
    <li>
        Lack of standardizing unlike in relational databases. Uncertain future.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cross platform support. Improvements being made but not as good as SQL.
    </li>
    <li>
        Not many useful management tools or console access.
    </li>
</ul>

<h6>When to use SQL vs NoSQL</h6>

<ul>
    <li>
        Data must be consistent with no room for error = SQL
    </li>
    <li>
        Budget is low = NoSQL
    </li>
    <li>
        Datastructures changes alot = NoSQL
    </li>
    <li>
        Analyzing large quantities of data in read only = NoSQL
    </li>
    <li>
        Event capture and processing = NoSQL
    </li>
    <li>
        Online stores with complex intelligence engines = NoSQL
    </li>
</ul>
