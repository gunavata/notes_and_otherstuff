<h1>Object oriented programming vs Functional programming</h1>

<p>
    OOP - programming paradigm based on concept of objects,</br>
    which are <b>data structures</b> that contain <b>data</b></br>
    in the form of <b>fields, AKA attributes</b>, and <b>code, AKA procedures often known as methods</b>.
</p>

<p>
    FP - programming paradigm, style of building the structure</br>
    and elements of computer programs. Treates computation as evalutation</br>
    of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data</br>
</p>

<p>
    Two primary components, data (stuff programm knows) and</br>
    behaviours (stuff program can do to/with data).</br>
    </br>
    OOP = bring data together and its associated behaviour in</br>
    one location (object) to make it easier to understand</br>
    </br>
    FP = data and behaviour distinctively different and should</br>
    be seperated for clarity
</p>

<p>
    FP leans heavily on tiny methods that do one small part of a</br>
    larger job called composition</br>
</p>

<p>
    FP likes to view everything as a data transformation: you start with</br>
    this dataset, apply transformations then generate new dataset</br>
</p>

<p>
    Similarties:</br>
    <ul>
        <li>Create understandable, flexible programs, bug free.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Preference to use:</br>
    If it can be easily described as a result of actions applied to results of other actions, FP is simpler to adopt.</br>
    It it can be described as a collection of objects, interacting in a sort relational network, then OOP will work better.</br>
    </br>
    A decent rule of thumb is if you're adding new things OOP tends to be a better fit, if you're adding new operations FP tends to be a better fit.</br>
    </br>
    The general way to think about OOP vs FP, is in terms of "things" vs "actions".</br>
    </br>
    So if you find yourself more so thinking about the problem in terms of "things" doing stuff,</br>
    then go with an object approach. Let's say you had a bunch of bouncing balls on the screen,</br>
    OOP works well with this because you have ball "things" everywhere and they share properties and functionality.</br>
    </br>
    As far as FP goes, FP is generally more difficult to get but a purely FP approach to a problem</br>
    is basically starting out with your data, and then using "actions"/functions to transform it</br>
    into some result that you want. So something like getting certain data from a JSON object can be done purely with FP.</br>
