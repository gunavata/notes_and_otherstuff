<h4>What is it? - Way of thinking of software construction/methodology (Not language specific)</h4>

<h1>Types of PP</h1>

<ul>
    <li>
        Declarative</br>
        HTML - CSS - SQL</br>
        Do something = WHAT HAPPENS?</br>
        Avoid the nitty gritty of how stuff happens</br>
        Ease of use!</br>
        Limited to smaller instruction set</br>
    </li>
</br>
    <li>
        Imperative</br>
        Java - C# (Sharp) - C++ - Javascript - Python - Ruby</br>
        Do Something = HOW HAPPENS?</br>
        Be explicit on how to do something</br>
        Alot more control!</br>
        Requires painstaking details</br>
        Apply logic!</br>
        </br>
        Sequenced instructions (Algorithms) - Carry out instructions in order to do something</br>
        Mutable data - Data that can change over the duration of a program, states can change</br>
        Variables - Location where data is stored</br>
    </li>
</br>
    <li>
        Structured</br>
        Extension of Imperative programming</br>
        Make decision based on current states of data (If checks)</br>
        Allows repetition of data (A loop)</br>
    </li>
</br>
    <li>
        Procedural</br>
        Extension of Structured programming</br>
        Creation of function (AKA procedures/subroutines)</br>
        Good for breaking problems down into smaller chunks</br>
        Write code once to be used again and again (Refactoring)</br>
    </li>
</ul>

<h1>This is then pushed down to two major programming styles</h1>

<h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>

<p>See everything as OBJECTS with PROPERTIES and ACTIONS</p>
<p>Focus on grouping everything into classes, properties and behaviours that are common</p>
<p>Class is like a blueprint to create object</p>
<p>Objects are instances of the class</p>

<h2>Event Driven Programming</h2>

<p>Waits in the background for something to happen</p>
<p>Relies on triggers for codes to be put into action</p>

<h4>All have role to play in order to create a software that elicits positive emotional response from users</h4>
