<h1>Var vs Let vs Const</h1>

<h4>Important bits to understand</h4>

<ul>
    <li>
        Declaration vs Initialization</br>
        var d; = Declaration (creating a variable with undefinite)</br>
        var d = "hello world"; = Initalization (Assigned a value after declaration)</br>
    </li>
</br>
    <li>
        Scope - Defines where variables and cuntions are accessible inside your program.</br>
        Var = function scope, will not exist oustide of the function</br>
        Let = block scope, available inside the block it created
    </li>
</br>
    <li>
        Hoisting - The idea of declaring a variable without a assigning a value</br>
        Var = undefined when trying to access before it's declaration</br>
        Let = reference error when access before it's declaration</br>
        </br>
        In JS, (particularly functions), all var items used will be initially declared</br>
        with undefinined in the start before it is used/assigned a value</br>
    </li>
</br>
    <li>
        Const = pretty much same as Let EXCEPT:</br>
        Let can be reassigned , const can't </br>
        It is not exactly immutable, you can reassign a property or change</br>
        certain aspects of the const object however you cannot redeclare it</br>
    </li>

<p>
    In summary:</br>
    So to recap, var is function scoped and if you try to use a variable declared</br>
    with var before the actual declaration, you’ll just get undefined. const and</br>
    let are blocked scoped and if you try to use variable declared with let or</br>
    const before the declaration you’ll get a ReferenceError. Finally the difference</br>
    between let and const is that once you’ve assigned a value to const, you can’t</br>
    reassign it, but with let, you can.</br>
